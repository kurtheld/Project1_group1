latitude,Decimal degrees,Unprojected Y coordinate of site (WGS84 datum): fuzzed to the nearest 0.1 degree
longitude,Decimal degrees,Unprojected X coordinate of site (WGS84 datum): fuzzed to the nearest 0.1 degree
spp_richness,species / site,Observed species richness (graminoids plus forbs) at a site
N_dep_kghayr,kg N / ha /yr,Total nitrogen deposition: sum of NADP wet deposition (averaged over the grids from 1985-2011) and CMAQ dry deposition (average of 2002-2011)
precip_mm,mm,Annual precipitation normal from PRISM (1981-2010)
temp_C_ave,degrees Celcius,Annual average temperature normal from PRISM (1981-2010)
pH,pH scale,pH (field collected if available: SSURGO otherwise)
CL_kghayr_lower,kg N / ha /yr,Lower bound (2.5th percentile) of 95% confidence of Critical Load (CL) of nitrogen deposition calculated in Simkin et al. 2016
CL_kghayr_upper,kg N / ha /yr,Upper bound (97.5th percentile) of 95% confidence of Critical Load (CL) of nitrogen deposition calculated in Simkin et al. 2016
CL_kghayr,kg N / ha /yr,Critical Load (CL) of nitrogen deposition calculated in Simkin et al. 2016: predicted nitrogen deposition at which negative impacts on species richness begin
EX_kghayr,kg N / ha /yr,Exceedance of CL (N_dep_kghayr - CL_kghayr): positive values indicate an expected negative impact of of nitrogen deposition on species richness
